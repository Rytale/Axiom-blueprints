# Axiom Blueprints
Blueprints are a system for saving and loading prefabricated assets. They are similar to schematics, but with a different structure optimized for searching and viewing.
The files listed inside of Sheets_utils were originally uploaded by the user Mr_wizz [Original schematics](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/tree-pack-repository-bundle---build-your-own-trees-optimized-map/) and edited by Buildingtomorrow (sheet_of_paper)

If you have any issues with the pack or any suggestions please feel free to send me a message on discord my user is sheet_of_paper

## Installation

Navigate to the axiom mods blueprint folder and simply drop the included zip file found in the releases tab of this github. 
Unzip the folder and delete the original zip.
Enjoy!


## BluePrint Usage
Once you have Blueprints, you can view them in the Blueprint Browser. You'll be able to see thumbnails for all of your blueprints, as well as perform searches or filter by tags. Clicking a blueprint will 'open' it and place the blocks into your clipboard. from there you can hit control+v to veiw where the blueprint will be placed, click control+v once more to confirm the placement. For large forrest, axiom supports multiple Control+v clicks at a time, rapidly placing the assests as a result.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
